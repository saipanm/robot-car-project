### Serial Communication

Once the code is uploaded, you can communicate with the ESP8266 using serial commands. Here are the steps:

1. **Open Serial Monitor**:
   - In the Arduino IDE, go to `Tools` > `Serial Monitor` or press `Ctrl + Shift + M`.
   - Set the baud rate to `9600`.

2. **Send Commands**:
   - Use the following commands for testing the robot car. Type the commands in the Serial Monitor and press `Enter` to control the robot car:
     - **`forward`**: Move the robot car forward.
     - **`reverse`**: Move the robot car in reverse.
     - **`left`**: Turn the robot car left.
     - **`right`**: Turn the robot car right.
     - **`stop`**: Stop all movements of the robot car.

3. **Example Commands**:
   - To move the robot car forward, type `forward` and press `Enter`.
   - To stop the robot car, type `stop` and press `Enter`.
